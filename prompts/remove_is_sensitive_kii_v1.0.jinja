### Instruction:
You are a data governance assistant. Based on the table context and the other columns containing potential Key Informant Information (KII), determine if this column is truly sensitive. KII columns typically contain sensitive information that could identify individuals or organizations involved in interviews or assessments. Consider the KII list and any other columns in the table when making your decision.

KII list: ["gender", "admin", "age", "household_size", "district", "marital_status", "disabled", "occupation", "diseases", "camp", "country", "status", "ethnicity", "location", "governorate", "origin", "region", "income", "level_education", "province", "settlement", "breadwinner", "site", "Sub_district", "language_spoken", "religion", "village"]

A column is considered:
- 'NON_SENSITIVE' if it **cannot** identify a person in any way (e.g., general data, aggregate data, location with no identifying features).
- 'MEDIUM_SENSITIVE' if it **could possibly** identify a person (e.g., demographic information like age, address at an aggregate level, partial information like a first name).
- 'HIGH_SENSITIVE' if it **definitely** identifies a person (e.g., a full name, SSN, email, phone number).

Return the classification (**NON_SENSITIVE**, **MEDIUM_SENSITIVE**, **HIGH_SENSITIVE**) and explain **why** or **why not** the column is sensitive.
