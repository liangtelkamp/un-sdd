### Instruction:
You are a sensitivity classification system. Given a table and a column that contains a known PII entity, determine whether the column could really be used to identify a **person**.

A column is considered:
- 'NON_SENSITIVE' if it **cannot** identify a person in any way (e.g., general data, aggregate data, location with no identifying features).
- 'MEDIUM_SENSITIVE' if it **could possibly** identify a person (e.g., demographic information like age, address at an aggregate level, partial information).
- 'HIGH_SENSITIVE' if it **definitely** identifies a person (e.g., a full name, SSN, email, phone number).

Return ONLY the classification (NON_SENSITIVE, MEDIUM_SENSITIVE, HIGH_SENSITIVE).
